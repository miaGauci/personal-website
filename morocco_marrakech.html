      <h1>Everything you need to know before visiting Marrakech</h1>
      <p class="post-date">Published on January 10, 2025</p>
      <div class="post-text">
      <h3>Must-Read for First Time Visitors - </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> <strong> VISA: </strong>  There is no need to apply for VISA when visiting Morocco, at passport control they will give you a temporary VISA which is valid for up to 90 days. 
          Note: the queues are quiet lengthy at boarder control and the airport wifi is very weak, we spent 1.5 hours queuing for passport control when we landed and 
          I have read that some people waited up to 3 hours to actually get out of the Marrakech airport. </li>
        <li> <strong> MONEY: </strong>  Morocco has a closed currency, the Moroccan Dirhams. You can withdraw cash from an ATM once you are in Morocco or bring cash with you and exchange 
          the cash in a currency exchange, the most popular and affordable one in Marrakech is ‘Hotel Ali’. 
          Pro Tip: Avoid converting your cash in the airport as the exchange fees are harsh! </li>
        <li> <strong> MOBILE DATA: </strong> If you wish to have data once you land in Morocco you need to buy an eSim, it is a non hassle way of having data on your phone. I used Airalo,
           you type in your destination country and it gives you different data bundles. It is on the more expensive side since just 1 Gb costs 8 euro, 2 Gb costs 15e etc but 
           the other option is to buy a SIM card once you land in Morocco which will cost around 2 euro and than you have to buy a data top up card, by doing so the price is considerably cheaper having 5 euros for 5 Gb but you have to stay hassling to buy a SIM card from a cellur vendor, installing it on your phone, topping it up etc. So for a short trip I recommend getting an eSim</li>
        <li> <strong> PLUG TYPE: </strong>  In Morocco they use the type C plug type just like Italy so anyone coming from the Malta or the UK watch out!  </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Getting Around Marrakech - </h3>

      <p> <h4> Walking </h4> 

        You can pretty much walk everywhere if you stay in a Riad in the Medina. For all the female travellers reading this, you don’t have to worry about receiving snarky looks from men, 
        but the roads are chaotic with motorbikes, cars, and crowds of people. If you're heading out of the Medina, I recommend taking a taxi. In the radius of the Medina everywhere is reachable with a 30 minute walk and this way you get to stumble upon boutique shops and other small shops which are worth visiting. 
        Especially when visiting the souks, taking a taxi isn't an option, so walking is necessary.

        The only downside to walking through the streets is the smell. 
        There's a lot of pollution, and our clothes always smelt like smoke. Some streets have a strange drainage odour. But then, when you walk into a restaurant or a Riad, you're greeted with an intense perfume smell, which contrasts sharply with the streets. 
        <strong>Note:</strong> Visiting Marrakech is not only a visual experience but also an experience for your nose.</p>

      <p> <h4> Taxis  </h4> 
        Ha! Morocco still works by hailing a cab, but there are thousands of these yellow taxis everywhere. The Medina streets are quite narrow, so cars can't pass through. At the end of the souks, you'll find plenty of yellow taxis waiting. Every time you pass by, you'll probably hear them offer you a ride at least 10 times with their "taxi, taxi, taxi" chant. The issue is they often overcharge, more than double the price.

        <p><strong>Using Taxi Apps - </strong>
        Before arriving in Marrakech, I found a taxi app called inDrive. However, while in Morocco I realise that it's actually illegal! Here, you need to understand their local culture, which works on a first-come, first-served basis, and no taxi driver should contradict another when it comes to prices because, for them, it’s super disrespectful.
        
        We nearly caused a fight trying to catch a taxi. We needed to get to the CTM bus station, and from the inDrive app, I knew it cost 3 euros, so I booked a ride through inDrive, but the driver couldn't pick us up because other taxis were around. If the yellow taxi drivers see that someone got tourists using the app, they cause absolute havoc.</p>
        
        <p><strong> Dealing with Taxi Drivers -</strong>
        
        So, we tried approaching the taxi drivers on the street. I told them 5 euros to the station, and this taxi driver told me 6 euros and wouldn’t budge. So, I told him no and kept walking. The taxi parked behind him told us that he’d take us for 5 euros. We put the luggage in the car and got in the taxi, and then they started arguing and fist fighting because the taxi driver contradicted the price set by the first taxi driver. We quickly got out of the taxi and walked to a quieter street with no taxis in sight and booked a taxi from inDrive.</p>
        
        <p><strong> PRO TIP: </strong>
        I recommend ignoring all the taxi drivers shouting "taxi, taxi, taxi." Walk to a spot where no taxis are in sight, then book your ride using the app. The prices are about half of what you'd pay otherwise. For example, using inDrive, a taxi ride from the Medina to the Marrakech Airport costs 5 euros, but if you try booking through your accommodation or hailing a taxi from the street, they will charge you 15 euros. </p>

      <h2>Where to stay:</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re visiting Marrakech, you must stay in a Riad. A Riad is a traditional Moroccan house with an interior garden or courtyard. They offer a unique and authentic experience that hotels simply can't match. We stayed at two different Riads: Riad Palais Calipau and Riad Agathe & Spa, and they were both amazing. The architecture and interior design of these Riads are stunning, featuring intricate tile work, beautiful archways, and vibrant colors. The central courtyards are lush with greenery, often surrounding a serene pool, creating a peaceful oasis amidst the bustling city.</p>
      
      <p>
        Riad Palais Calipau had a pool in the middle of the courtyard surrounded by lush plants that match the blue and green colour scheme, creating a lively yet peaceful ambiance. The Riad had an excellent interior, and the attendant kindly met us on the main road where the taxi dropped us off, carrying our luggage the entire ally way to the Riad. We booked the deluxe double room, which was very spacious and comfortable, and the breakfast was also good. Unfortunately, there wasn't a WiFi connection in our room, but it turned out to be a nice way to cut off from social media and fully enjoy our stay.        
      </p>

      <p>
        After our surfing trip, we stayed at Riad Agathe & Spa, where we were greeted with some Moroccan tea (the best I had in Marrakech) and biscuits. This Riad had a more spacious courtyard with a pond, and the pool was on the roof, though it wasn’t heated. Our room was super nice, with comfortable beds. The room was always spotless, with daily towel changes. The breakfast was also good. I would totally recommend this Riad to anyone visiting Marrakech      </p>

      <p>
        Here is my saved list of all the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/d4izTKV4mZCj1Y1u6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">must-visit places in Capri</a>.

      <h2>Exploring Nearby Cities From Marrakech:      </h2>
      <p>
        When traveling to other cities in Morocco, using CTM or Supratours buses is highly recommended. They are both comfortable and affordable options. We used CTM to get to Agadir and Supratours to return to Marrakech. The tickets were just 10 euros per person for a 4-hour bus ride, which is a great deal. The bus stations can be a bit chaotic, but you can simply go to the ticket booth and ask for directions, and they'll help you find your way.
      </p>
      <p>
        For booking excursions, I highly recommend using GetYourGuide. It's super easy to book activities like camel rides in Palm Grove or quad biking. Most of these trips will pick you up and drop you off at your accommodation, making the experience very smooth and convenient.      </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, if you're looking to explore beyond Marrakech, consider taking day trips to nearby destinations like the Atlas Mountains, Essaouira, or Ouzoud Waterfalls which can all be booked using GetYourGuide. These places offer stunning landscapes and unique experiences that are well worth the visit.
        </p>
    

      <h2>The Food and Beverage Scene in Morocco: </h2>
      <p>
        You can’t visit Morocco without trying a tangine – it’s a classic Moroccan dish, slow-cooked with meat, veggies, and spices in their signature conical pots. In Morocco you can also find Camel Meat, so if you want to try it out head to Café Clock and try their camel burger – it was actually super good!      </p>

        <p>In Morocco you can’t drink the tap water and their bottled water isn’t too good either. An amazing alternative is their fresh fruit juices and smoothies; I have never tasted such good fruit in my life. Every opportunity I had I ordered a fresh fruit juice or smoothie. </p>

        <p>For something fancy, we went to Les Jardins du Lotus. You have to go through a rundown house and than you get to big red velvety curtains and it opens up to a massive courtyard with the best vibes. Here we had Gnocchi with Buffalo and Spaghetti à la Truffle – honestly, two of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had. Another spot we tried out which was highly recommended was Le Jardin Restaurant, which has four terraces all decorated with a very nice turquoise tile. We went during lunchtime, and it was super busy – though that might have been because it was a Sunday. We ordered the chicken tangine and octopus from Agadir, and both were amazing.</p>
        
        <p>For a more upscale take on Moroccan food, we tried Le Trou Au Mur, which has a luxurious take on Moroccan traditional dishes. The Camel Tagine and lamb cuts were delicious, and the place had a great vibe for a special night out. On the other hand, the street food here is also fantastic – we had kebabs and shawarmas with all the Moroccan spices, and they were perfect for a quick and tasty meal.</p>
        
        <p>Breakfasts at the riads were a highlight. They usually included fresh orange juice, homemade yogurt, Moroccan tea or coffee, fresh fruit, msemen (Moroccan pancakes) with jams, bread, butter, omelettes, and even some cakes. It was such a great way to start the day – simple but full of flavour and freshness.</p>

      <h2>Must Visit Spots in Marrakech: </h2>
      <p>During my trip to Marrakech, I visited some fantastic places that I’d highly recommend. Jardin Majorelle is an absolute must-see. We paid €17.50 with our student cards and made sure to go first thing in the morning, as it gets very busy later in the day. The garden is beautifully maintained, with a wide variety of cacti and trees from around the world. The Musée Pierre Bergé des Arts Berbères, located within the garden, is also worth exploring—it provides fascinating insights into the history of the Berber people from the Atlas Mountains. Nearby, the YSL Museum is another great spot, showcasing Yves Saint Laurent’s legacy and designs in an elegant setting. These 3 attractions are all located next to each other so you can do them all in one go. </p>

      <p>The souks are a vibrant and chaotic experience, offering everything from spices and textiles to handcrafted goods. Wandering through the narrow alleyways was an adventure in itself. Souk Semmarine, often the first you’ll encounter, is framed by a large iron trellis and packed with tourist-oriented souvenirs. Each souk specialises in something unique: Souk de Bijouters for jewellery, Souk Smata for traditional Moroccan babouches (slippers), and Souk Cherratin for leather goods like bags and belts. Souk Chouari focuses on carpentry, with fragrant cedar wood items, while Souk Haddadine and Souk des Chaudronniers are where blacksmiths and coppersmiths work their craft. For a splash of history, Souk des Teinturiers offers a glimpse into the traditional dyeing process, with fabrics drying along the streets.</p>

      <p>If haggling isn’t your thing, the Ensemble Artisanal Market is a calmer alternative. Prices are fixed and slightly higher than in the souks, but the quality is excellent, and the stress-free shopping is worth it.</p>

      <p><strong>PRO TIP:</strong>  Haggling .. Merchants usually start with a high price, so aim for about 25%–30% of their initial offer.</p>

      Another place I enjoyed was Ben Youssef Madrasa, a historic Islamic college with stunning architecture and intricate tile work.</p>


        <p>There are a few other well-known spots in Marrakech, like Palais Bahia and Koutoubia Mosque, but I decided not to visit them as they didn’t seem particularly exceptional compared to what I had already seen. That said, if you have extra time, they might still be worth checking out for their cultural significance.</p>
      
     <h2>Departure:</h2>
      <p> <p>Departing from Marrakech airport requires a bit of extra planning, so make sure you're well-prepared by following these steps; First, it’s essential to print your boarding passes before you arrive, as digital versions might are NOT accepted. We flew with Ryanair and their website warned us to print the boarding pass as the digital version is not accepted. To avoid any last-minute stress, aim to get to the airport at least 3.5 hours before your flight as there are many queues you need to wait in. Even if you don’t have any checked luggage, you still need to visit the check-in desk to have your documents verified and receive an official stamp for boarding. The process can be a bit time-consuming, so arriving early gives you plenty of time to navigate through it all without any hassle. </p>

      <p>When you arrive at the airport, the first step is going through scanners at the entrance. After that, head to the check-in desk, where they’ll print your boarding pass, check your documents, and stamp your ticket. Once that’s sorted, proceed to security to have your bags checked. Next, go to passport control to get your passport stamped. After completing these steps, you’re free to relax and wait to board your flight.</p>

      <h2> Walk back to the Centre</h2>
      <p> 
        Instead, we walked back to the centre, a 20-minute uphill journey. It was hot, but it was still manageable, and the walk allowed us to see some beautiful houses and hotels along the way. 
        Once we reached the main area, we treated ourselves to some ice cream, make sure to try the lemon sorbet—it’s a must when visiting the island. 
        When it comes to ice-cream vendors on Capri, most have similar prices, so don’t worry too much about hunting for the cheapest option.
      </p>

      </div>
      
      <p> We also decided to try another salumeria in the centre, Salumeria Rosticceria Capro Verde, but the sandwiches were €2 more expensive than at our favourite spot and not as good. 
        After this, we explored the shops in the centre. I picked up a small souvenir, a fish-themed bucket hat for Sam, which was a fun little keepsake from the trip.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        Later, we walked back down to the terminal to swim again, this time at Spiaggia Marina Grande. The stairs leading down were shaded and quiet, making the walk easy and pleasant. 
        We played cards on the beach until it was time to leave.
      </p>

      <p> We had planned to take the ferry during sunset to enjoy the view, but the weather was hazy and foggy, so there wasn’t much of a sunset. 
        Still, it was a good way to end the day before heading back. </p>
