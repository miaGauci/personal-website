      <h1>How to Explore Capri on a Budget: A Perfect Day Trip Guide</h1>
      <p class="post-date">Published on November 17, 2024</p>
      <div class="post-text">
      <h2>Getting Around Capri</h2>
      <p>
        The only way to reach Capri is by boat. While private charters are an option, the most budget-friendly approach is to take a tourist ferry. I highly recommend using the FerryHopper website or app. It aggregates all available ferries, allowing you to compare prices and schedules effortlessly. Prices vary depending on the ferry company and time of departure. 
        We took the NLG jet, which had the shortest travel time to Capri but cost slightly more (€33 per person). For the return trip, we chose Alicost, which took 2 hours but was cheaper (€26.50 per person).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Book your tickets in advance, especially during the busy summer months, to avoid disappointment. Ferries can sell out, particularly for return trips from Capri. Arrive 30–45 minutes before departure (as noted on your ticket) to secure a good seat, as late arrivals might find only scattered seating options.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        At the terminal, you'll find ticket booths with English-speaking staff and clear signage in case you have questions or need to confirm your gate number.
      </p>

      <h2>Arrival at Capri</h2>
      <p>
        Once you step onto Capri, be prepared for a bustling port with taxis weaving through the crowd and travellers lugging suitcases. It might feel overwhelming, but take a deep breath—Capri’s charm awaits!
      
        You have two main options for your day:
      
      <ol>
        <li>Stay on mainland Capri.</li>
        <li>Visit Anacapri.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For this trip, we chose to stay on mainland Capri to explore the island on foot and soak in the stunning scenery.
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Bring plenty of water and wear a hat—heatstroke is no joke, as I learned the hard way!
      </p>

      <h2>Must-Try Food Stop: Salumeria da Aldo</h2>
      <p>
        First stop after arriving at the port: Salumeria da Aldo for the best Mediterranean sandwich you’ll ever eat! The Capri Sandwich, even for someone like me who’s not a tomato fan, was absolutely heavenly. We loved it so much we went back for seconds. 
        When we got home, we even tried recreating the sandwich ourselves—it's that good. Don’t skip this spot!

      <h2>Take the Funicular to the Centre</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of walking up the steep roads from the port, take the funicular. It’s an inexpensive and quick way to reach the centre of Capri without exhausting yourself right at the start. Bonus: it drops you off at a lovely viewing point! The funicular departs every 15 minutes, though more often when there are long lines. Tickets cost €2.40 one way and can be purchased at the ticket office near the pier.
      </p>

      <h2>Go around the Centre</h2>
      <p>Take your time to go around the capri centre. I'm not going to lie I got lost in the winding roads so I didn't get to see much of the centre in the morning 
       [although if you’re a coffee lover the small square is the perfect place to have your morning coffee] instead we kept walking down to Giardini di Augusto. 
       We opted not to go in because there was a lot of nature to see outside so we kept walking down Via Krupp which is a mesmerising piece of walkway on its own.  I did want to get closer to the I Faraglioni however there were only 2 beach clubs over there (and they are 2 of the most expensive clubs in Capri) and the view of the rocks wouldn't have been as great. So we decided to walk towards the cheaper and free beaches on Capri which are to West side of the island. Via Krupp has incredible views of I faraglioni and the sea.

      <h2>Go to a Free Beach</h2>
      <p> We arrived at Spiaggia di Marina Piccola, a small rocky beach tucked away between two beach clubs, which made it very crowded. 
        If you’re considering a beach club, it’s worth it for the shade and comfort, especially under the July sun. However, the cost for two sunbeds and an umbrella starts at €30, depending on the location. 
        If you’re travelling on a budget, it might not be worth it unless you plan to spend the entire day there.

      <h2> </h2>
      <p> We got to the beach at noon, and it was unbearably hot. Sitting on the rocks wasn’t a viable option in that heat. 
        After a quick swim, I started feeling dizzy, which was likely the beginning of a heatstroke, so we went to the nearest restaurant for some shade and drinks. Be prepared—cocktails on Capri start at €16, and that’s for the cheapest option. 
        We stayed at the restaurant playing cards until the heat eased up, which became our routine from 12–3 pm during the trip to avoid the intense midday sun.
        Afterwards, we had the choice of taking the bus back to the centre, but we decided against it because:
        1. The buses are very small.
        2. They’re always packed.
      </p>

      <h2> Walk back to the Centre</h2>
      <p> 
        Instead, we walked back to the centre, a 20-minute uphill journey. It was hot, but it was still manageable, and the walk allowed us to see some beautiful houses and hotels along the way. 
        Once we reached the main area, we treated ourselves to some ice cream, make sure to try the lemon sorbet—it’s a must when visiting the island. 
        When it comes to ice-cream vendors on Capri, most have similar prices, so don’t worry too much about hunting for the cheapest option.
      </p>

      <p> We also decided to try another salumeria in the centre, Salumeria Rosticceria Capro Verde, but the sandwiches were €2 more expensive than at our favourite spot and not as good. 
        After this, we explored the shops in the centre. I picked up a small souvenir, a fish-themed bucket hat for Sam, which was a fun little keepsake from the trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, we walked back down to the terminal to swim again, this time at Spiaggia Marina Grande. The stairs leading down were shaded and quiet, making the walk easy and pleasant. 
        We played cards on the beach until it was time to leave.
      </p>

      <p> We had planned to take the ferry during sunset to enjoy the view, but the weather was hazy and foggy, so there wasn’t much of a sunset. 
        Still, it was a good way to end the day before heading back. </p>
